# IMix
Simple Colour Mixer for IOS that uses objective-c coding and allows the user to mix RGBA channels to achieve a certain color.

This is a small project I created while at University, the aim was to simply get used to coding in XCode and make a start on Objective-C. The aim of the project was to practise constraints, coding and designing simple yet an effective UI for iOS development purporses. 

The purporse of the application was to use the RGBA channels to make colours and display them at the end.
